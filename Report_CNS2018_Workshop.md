## Workshop report: Developing, standardising and sharing large scale cortical network models¶

**A workshop at CNS 2018, Tues 17th July, Allen Institute, Seattle**

### Background

A number of groups around the world are developing complex, experimentally constrained 
models of cortical function. Creating the software infrastructure to develop, simulate 
and share these types of models takes a significant amount of time for any of the groups 
involved and there can be a lot of overlap, duplication in work and repeated effort.

The purpose of this workshop was to highlight some of the initiatives currently underway to build 
detailed cortical models as well as those projects building the infrastructure to make 
it easier to develop, disseminate and compare the models.
